My first Project with node.js from SK Intensive node.js course.  It is lack of validation and need message and error managing.  The folder structure isn't suitable for huge project.

# What I learn and practice with this Project
1. Understood about express.js frame work and node.js asynchronous behavior.
2. MySQL transaction and optimizing queries.

# Need To Improve
1. Add validations for stable server.
2. The project structrue should change and test automation for extend its size.
3. Tidy up messages and error handling for maintaining.
4. Refactoring API URI and variable names.
