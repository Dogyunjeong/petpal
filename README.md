0. Total developing period: 4 weeks with risk managements.
1. It is focused on understanding callback chain as using promise is easier and offering high redability.
2. It is only use mySql module to understand and be familiar to sql query.
3. Tried to use stand sql.
My first Project with node.js from SK Intensive node.js course.  It is lack of validation and need message and error managing.  The folder structure isn't suitable for huge project.

# What I learn and practice with this Project
1. Understood about express.js frame work and node.js asynchronous behavior.
2. MySQL transaction and optimizing queries.

# Need To Improve
1. Add validations for stable server.
2. The project structrue should change and test automation for extend its size.
3. Tidy up messages and error handling for maintaining.
4. Refactoring API URI and variable names.

# /models/queryFunction.js
  This is showing my understanding about my sql query optimizing and code redabilaty using async.
  First goal was to create reusable function for query.
  Second goal was  to Optimize queries in an API.
  Third goal was to increase redabilities in models as huge query and it's callback chain reduced redabilities.
